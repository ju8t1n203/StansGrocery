As I was going over the instructions I noticed that you wanted the information to be formatted into an array from the file.
Considering once i saw this, being almost done ive chosen to ignore this fact.
My code pulls the information straight from the file and formats it from there.
The end result is still the same (i think) just the process to get there is different.
